Hi! I'm f78, a 21-year-old guy from Belgium who likes to play games
like [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us){:external} and [Terraria](https://www.terraria.org/){:external}, code
things and make music. Iâ€™m currently spending most of my time studying programming at
college<span class="asterisk">\*</span>.

{:.small}
<span class="asterisk">\*</span>: Translated from "hogeschool" in Dutch according to Google Translate. I'm not sure if
this is accurate, as school names in English vs. Dutch confuse me...

## My Socials

Please keep in mind that I'm busy with college, so I'm unable to actively make content for the time being.
